### Boolean don't care conditions

Boolean don't care conditions may be divided into two sets. Patterns that may occur at the inputs of 
the network are *controlled* by external environment in which the network is embedded. This constraint on
the sorroundings of the network gives rise to *controllability don't care set* (CDC).
