### Boolean don't care conditions

Boolean don't care conditions may be divided into two sets. Patterns that may occur at the inputs of 
the network are *controlled* by external environment in which the network is embedded. This constraint on
the sorroundings of the network gives rise to *controllability don't care set* (CDC). 

The below figure shows a Boolean network *E3* (4-input AND gate) embedded in an environment. *E1* is the upstream logic which feeds the inputs of *E3*, while the output of *E3* feeds into the downstream logic network *E2*. Note that *E1* is *only* capable of producing inputs shown in the figure (0110, 1000, 1001, 1100). All other outputs cannot be produced by the upstream logic by design.

Hence, *E1* *controls* which Boolean inputs may be applied to *E3*. 

Consider the Boolean network below in which the downstream logic now has a single AND gate with output *O1*. The inputs are *r1* and *Y*. Hence, O1 = r1 AND Y. Note that *r1* (which feeds input *a* of the four input AND gate in *E3*, i.e, a = r1) now *controls* propagation of the input Y through the AND gate in downstream logic.

If *r1 = 1*, then O1 = <font color="red"> r1 AND Y </font> = <font color="blue"> 1 AND Y </font> = Y. However, if *r1 = 0*, then *irrespective* of the logic value of Y, O1 is 0. What is the implication of this observation ?

*a = r1* is also the input to the 4-input AND gate whose output is Y. Can the observation above be used to optimize *E3* ? Since *r1 = 0*, *a = 0*. Now, when a = 0, the logic value of Y does not matter, since the AND gate in the downstream logic prevents the propagation of Y to the output O1. Hence, Y *does not matter* means in Boolean logic jargon that Y is *don't care* when *a = 0*.
