### Boolean don't care conditions

Boolean don't care conditions may be divided into two sets. Patterns that may occur at the inputs of 
the network are *controlled* by external environment in which the network is embedded. This constraint on
the sorroundings of the network gives rise to *controllability don't care set* (CDC). 

The below figure shows a Boolean network *E3* (4-input AND gate) embedded in an environment. *E1* is the upstream logic which feeds the inputs of *E3*, while the output of *E3* feeds into the downstream logic network *E2*. Note that *E1* is *only* capable of producing inputs shown in the figure (0110, 1000, 1001, 1100). All other outputs cannot be produced by the upstream logic by design.

Hence, *E1* *controls* which Boolean inputs may be applied to *E3*.
